abstract={Agile software development methodologies, such as Scrum, have gained tremendous popularity and proven successful in quickly delivering quality Functional Requirements (FRs). However, agile methodologies have not adequately modeled Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) and their potential solutions (operationalizations) with FRs in early development phases. This research proposes three fundamental agile artifacts to model FRs, NFRs, and their potential solutions in a visual environment. First, FRs are modeled through Agile Use Cases (AUCs). Second, NFRs are modeled through Agile Loose Cases (ALCs). Third, NFRs potential solutions are modeled through Agile Choose Cases (ACCs). AUCs are newly proposed hybrid of use cases and agile user stories. ALCs are proposed loosely-defined agile NFRs. ACCs are proposed potential solutions (operationalizations) for ALCs. The three artifacts are combined in a visual framework to promote agile modeling of NFRs (primarily) and how they are linked to FRs. The artifacts are the building blocks of a more comprehensive framework for modeling NFRs in agile software development processes.},

title={Hidden facilitators of agile transition: Agile coaches and agile champions}, 
pages={246-250}, 
abstract={Prevalence of Agile methods in software companies is increasing. Software companies need to employ these methods to overcome the inherent challenges of traditional methods. However, transitioning to Agile approach is a topic of debate and needs to be supported by appropriate facilitators. Conducting a large-scale research study, revealed the most important Agile transition facilitators. This paper solely presents two hidden facilitators of Agile transition, Agile coaches and Agile champions, which rarely have been taken into consideration. Both of these facilitators directly impress the people involved in the transition. People-intensive nature of Agile methods and critical role of the people in the transition process reflect the importance of these facilitators when a software company is in the transition process. This study showed that considering these facilitators when can highly impress the success of the transition and revealed the real responsibilities of Agile coaches and Agile champions when transitioning to Agile.},
